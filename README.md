# Track Meet
A program that connects to a database (meant to emulate a school of athletes attending a track meet) to allow officials to score athletes and the track meet. Includes options for adding/scoring individual athletes, getting results for a particular event, disqualifying athletes, and scoring an event or the entire meet<br><br>


# What I Learned
